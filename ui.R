  p("In this investigation, we are exploring the representation of LGBTQ characters, specifically in cartoon shows made for children and teenagers. We want to know how the frequency of representation has changed over time, and when characters are explicitly stated to be LGBTQ or only implied as such. This has been a matter of importance and pride for the LGBTQ community to see themselves reflected in the media. For young children who are struggling with their identity and sexuality, seeing positive examples in television can be transformative for them. Since this is something the community has been fighting for a long time to see, it is most informative to compare how representation has changed over the years. We are also interested in how race, gender and orientation intersect. Seeing how representation of, say, transgender characters may or may not differ depending on their race is important to have a better understanding of what gaps persist in bringing greater diversity to childrenâ€™s entertainment. A crucial part of using data science to challenge power in this regard is making those in power take responsibility for the effects of their actions. This includes knowing what entertainment companies are doing the worst at, including representation of characters that are not straight, cisgender men."),

  (", in order to research this further. Parsed by Insider.com's Bradd Carey, it contains hand collected and verified data of LGBTQ characters in children's cartoons from 1996 to today. Included with orientation is how the orientation was represented in the show, how it was confirmed, creating studio, character role, show rating and other characteristics. After reviewing the dataset, we found some limitations. For some LGBTQ characters of youth cartoons in the database, they lack the mention of their race, and/or they are not human. Similarly, some characters have an unknown orientation. This would probably lead to a harder time finding correlations between race, representation, gender, and/or orientation. Also, in the data set we found, if a character did not have an orientation listed, their gender written down would be slightly different than the characters that did. This will make it a little harder for our code to parse through our data. Another challenge is that many of the characters come from the same shows and puts most of the data into one place, limiting our variance. Additionally, the years column only goes back until 1996. This limits our dataframe to cartoons made only after that time, so that we cannot see if there were any LGBTQ cartoon characters before then. However, the dataset is still effective and valid enough to investigate, as it includes an abundance of information on LGTQ characters throughout the years that is too powerful to ignore. Hopefully, our research can bring about more positive reinforcement, acceptance, awareness, education, and inclusion of LGBTQ members to the youth populations and beyond." )),

Our first takeaway was from our first graph, LGBTQ characters over time, that displays how as the years go on, the number of LGBTQ characters being introduced into children cartoons has increased significantly. This is a good sign that LGBTQ characters are showing up increasingly in children cartoons, which is a good step towards representation. "),
    p(" However, there are still some steps to be made. Our second takeaway came in our second graph, Explicit Representation of LGBTQ characters by role, and we can see that guest characters actually have the most explicit representation, while the least representation comes from main characters. This is still something the animation film industry could work on, as incorporating explicit representation to main characters could result in further awareness and acceptance from the audience cheering on and looking up to the main characters. "),
    p(" Our third takeaway comes from our third graph, Representation of LGBTQ characters over time by Race, and we found that as time went on, representation did grow for all races, but the most represented was the 'N/A' race. Although this could mean that there was not an explicit race for the character, it could also mean that the character was of a different species (for example, an animal, alien, or other lifeforms). In the future, having LGBTQ characters as an explicit human race, especially POC, could lead to more purposeful awareness for real life people. Children would realize that LGBTQ characters exist in real life all around them, and not just as an alien in a cartoon TV show. "),
